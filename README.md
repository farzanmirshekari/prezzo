<h1>Prezzo</h1>

Prezzo is a text-based presentation creator that leverages a Markdown-like notation style to cut creation time to a minimum and saving nerves in the process. The design engine automatically adjusts the design of your slides to craft a modern and minimalistic presentation, so you can focus only on your story.

<h3>Origins</h3>

The motivation was to be able to be able to just type out the content I want to see in a presentation and not have to worry about the design. I wanted a tool to take in content (images, text, what have you) and generate a slide deck that is ready to go.
